A Brief Introduction to the Basics of Game Theory

Matthew O. Jackson, Stanford University

I provide a (very) brief introduction to game theory. I have developed these notes to

provide quick access to some of the basics of game theory; mainly as an aid for students

in courses in which I assumed familiarity with game theory but did not require it as a

prerequisite. Of course, the material discussed here is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg,

and there are many sources that oﬀer much more complete treatments of the sub ject.1 Here,

I only cover a few of the most fundamental concepts, and provide just enough discussion

to get the ideas across without discussing many issues associated with the concepts and

approaches. Fuller coverage is available through a free on-line course that can be found via
my website: http://www.stanford.edu/∼jacksonm/
The basic elements of performing a noncooperative 2 game-theoretic analysis are (1)

framing the situation in terms of the actions available to players and their payoﬀs as a

function of actions, and (2) using various equilibrium notions to make either descriptive or

2 “Noncooperative game theory” refers to models in which each players are assumed to behave selﬁshly

and their behaviors are directly modeled. “Cooperative game theory,” which I do not cover here, generally

refers to more abstract and axiomatic analyses of bargains or behaviors that players might reach, without

explicitly modeling the processes. The name “cooperative” derives in part from the fact that the analyses

often (but not always) incorporate coalitional considerations, with important early analyses appearing in

John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern’s 1944 foundational book “Theory of Games and Economic

Behavior.”
